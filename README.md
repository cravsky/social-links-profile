## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I practiced reading Figma designs. I learned that 90% of design implementation takes 10% of time. And the rest 10% of work takes 90% of time.

### Continued development

I would like to improve translating Figma designs to CSS rules.
